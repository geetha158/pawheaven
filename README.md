🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Project: PawHeaven 🐾

I’m thrilled to announce the completion of my dummy website, PawHeaven, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React! 🎉

What I Learned & Built:
✨ Responsive Design: I implemented a fully responsive layout using HTML & CSS to ensure a great user experience on both desktop and mobile.

⚡ React Features:

React Router DOM: I used React Router DOM for smooth and efficient page switching between different components, allowing for a seamless navigation experience.
React Hooks: I utilized useState, useEffect, and useRef hooks to handle state, side effects, and references in functional components, making the app more dynamic and interactive.
🔄 Page Switching: With React Router DOM, navigating between pages was made simple and seamless, enhancing the user experience.

🖥️ Interactive Elements: I used JavaScript and React to add interactivity and make the website feel more engaging.

Some Key Features:
